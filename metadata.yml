Title: MolE molecular representation through redundancy reduced embeddings
Description: MolE representations (Molecular representation through redundancy reduced
  Embeddings) are task-independent, learned molecular embeddings generated through
  a self-supervised deep learning approach. They are designed to encode chemically
  meaningful information about molecules without needing labeled training data.
