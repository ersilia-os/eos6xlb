Title: MolE molecular representation through redundancy reduced embeddings
Description: 'MolE representations (Molecular representation through redundancy reduced Embeddings) are task-independent, learned molecular embeddings generated through a self-supervised deep learning approach. They are designed to encode chemically meaningful information about molecules without needing labeled training data.'
